          <h3>Rigorous and Comprehensive</h3>
          <p>Any good education starts with a teacher who has high expectations of their students. I truely believe that every student has great capacity to learn and grow with each school year. As with any skill, this can only happen when students practice perserverence and hard work, two vital aspects to my classroom. </p>

          <h3>Interactive and Entertaining</h3>
          <p class="skilldescription">Students learn the most when they are experimenting and problem solving in small groups. This is reflected in the lessons that I teach. I keep students engaged with entertaining lessons, with a heavy emphasis on group work.</p>

          <img class="skill-icon" src="images/love.png" alt="love-image">
          <h3>Caring and Compassionate</h3>
          <p>At the heart of every educator should be patience, kindness, and understanding. A good classroom is one where students feel safe to mistakes and feel comfortable asking questions. By modeling how a caring and compassionate educator should act, I hope to see those same behaviors in my students.</p>
